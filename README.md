# microjava-compiler
microJava is a simplified programming language and architecture used for educational purposes to teach the concepts of computer organization and programming languages. It's designed to be a simpler version of the Java programming language.

The microJava compiler takes source code written in the microJava programming language and converts it into machine code that can be executed on a microJava simulator. This involves several stages, including lexical analysis (breaking down the source code into tokens), syntax analysis (parsing the tokens into a structured representation), semantic analysis (checking the correctness of the code), and code generation (producing machine code).

The microJava compiler follows the standard structure of a compiler, which includes front-end and back-end components. The front-end is responsible for processing the source code and generating an intermediate representation, while the back-end generates the actual machine code based on the intermediate representation.
